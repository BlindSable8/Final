      <h2>Personal Recommendations</h2>
      <p>There are so many products on the market, photography accessories can be a confusing area to navigate. Photography is an industry like any other, so it's always trying to sell you something new. It can be difficult to know what you need and what you don't need. So,So I'll share the device I'm currently using, and why I chose it.</p>
      <h3>Lenses:</h3>
      <h4>XF 35mm F2</h4>
      <p>The comparatively high price does also show up in its build quality. The tightly assembled metal body is based on a metal mount. The very broad focus ring operates very smoothly. The lens has a dedicated aperture ring with very distinctive 1/3EV steps. A tiny barrel-shaped hood is part of the package. The lens features a weather- and dust-resistant structure with eight seals and can also work in temperatures as low as -10°C.</p>
      <h4>XF 10-24mm F4</h4>
      <p>The Fujifilm Fujinon XF 10-24mm F4 R OIS WR is a great ultra-wide zoom lens that makes an excellent more affordable alternative to the Fujifilm Fujinon XF8-16mmF2.8 R LM WR. It’s especially good at the widest focal lengths, but it delivers excellent results throughout its focal length and aperture range.It a great choice of lens for landscape photography, but it’s also useful for interior shots and street photography.</p>
      <h3>Filters:</h3>
      <h4>UV</h4>
      <p>The JJC Ultra Slim UV Protector Filter is a general use, clear filter that helps absorb ultraviolet light and reduces the bluish cast of daylight. It is also useful as a basic protective filter to leave on lenses at all times, which reduces dust, moisture and oil from reaching your lens element and provide additional protection in case of drops or situations where scratching could occur.</p>
      <h4>CPL&ND</h4>
      <p>PolarPro QuartzLine's filter is used on a camera lens the same way one uses sunglasses for the eyes. If the sun is too bright and overexposure is probable this filter will afford you the opportunity to capture the shot regardless of brightness.It helps keep the ISO low while also achieving the proper shutter speed need for filming using the 180 rule. </p>
      <h3>Tripods:</h3>
      <h4>SIRUI</h4>
      <p>Adjustable and Extendable: 5-Section Carbon Fiber Legs with Quick Release Twist-Locks Allow You to Adjust the Working Height From 6.3" to 54.3" in Seconds, While with a Folded Height of 13". 3-Position Leg Angle Adjustment System Can Provide Flexible Shooting for Different Photography Scenarios and Conditions.</p>
